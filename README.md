## Welcome to The Elevator Interface 

This interface is designed to ease the use of elevator, understand and facilitate the actions.  
A best attempt has been made to have this design follow the Elevator standards. 

You can view the standards on https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/buildings-and-sites/about-the-ada-standards/guide-to-the-ada-standards/chapter-4-elevators-and-platform-lifts#aralt for more information. 


Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
