## Welcome to The Elevator Interface 

This interface is designed to ease the use of elevator, understand and facilitate the actions.  <br /> 
A best attempt has been made to have this design follow the Elevator standards. 

## Elevator location:
This elevator is from Rawls College of Business Administration, Texas Tech University. 

## Design issues:
•	There is only one button for both the elevators.<br /> 
•	No status of the current location of the elevator from outside.<br /> 
•	Both elevators have a different number of floors buttons. 

## Reasons for bad design:
•	Upon pressing the button, one of the elevators opens the door and it’s hard to guess which one would open first when the button is pressed. <br /> 
•	Both the elevators have only one floor display sign to indicate on one of the corners, which would again be difficult – To verify <br /> 
•	The current floor number is visible, only when a user stands in close proximity to the elevator on top left and right corner. <br /> 
> -   There are chances when a user goes too close and the elevator door might open suddenly, and the people inside and outside the elevator might collide. <br /> 
> -	User has to look really high to read the floor number <br /> 
•	Doesn’t support features for people with disabilities 

## Common uses in an elevator:
•	Select the elevator touch panel button for the elevator to arrive at the current floor <br /> 
•	Choose the floor number button to go to the required floor <br /> 
•	Open and close the elevator door button 

## Rare uses in an elevator:
•	Emergency call button <br /> 
•	Emergency alarm button

•	For any assistance, select the Disability option <br /> 
•	The elevator door opens after it arrives at the current floor <br /> 
•	User enters the lift <br /> 
•	User has four options: <br /> 
* Select destination floor on the touch screen panel <br /> 
> -	Enter destination floor on the touch screen panel <br />

> -	In case of assistance or emergency, us the assistance option or emergency options on touch screen or button panel 
### Case-2:

•	For any assistance, select the Disability option <br /> 
•	The elevator door opens after it arrives at the current floor <br />

    o	Audio output: for ease and extra assistance <br /> 
    o	Up and down arrows: to navigate the elevator <br /> 
    o	Assistance option: for any further assistance <br />

    o	Two extra Touch panels: <br /> 
        	Elevator floor number status display on two front panels of elevator <br /> 
    o	Main Touch panel: <br /> 
        	Description of elevator number, capacity(lbs.), no. of people it can accommodate <br /> 
        	Date, time and current temperature <br /> 
        	Elevator status, floor numbers <br /> 
        	Choose destination floor, Enter destination floor <br />
